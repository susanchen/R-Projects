Retail Store Analysis
=================================================================================================================

# This project looks at different store attributes and analyzes 
which attributes drive sales performance, and to what extent.

# Filename: “stores”
# Store Performance Metric: “Sales”
# Store Attributes: “Alpha” (a categorical rank of stores), “Climate”, “SF” (Sq. Ft.), “Density.Cap”, “Region”

=================================================================================================================

> stores <- read.csv(file.choose(),head=TRUE,sep=",")
# Open the file that we choose: "stores"

> str(stores)
# Ask to see the structure of this data object

> summary(stores)
# Get a data summary

> attach(stores)
# Make the variables inside “stores” visible to R

> by(stores,Alpha,summary)
# Summarize each Alpha group separately

> by(stores,Climate,summary)
# Summarize each Climate group separately

> boxplot(Sales ~ Climate)
# Boxplot showing Climate’s relationship to Sales

> boxplot(Sales ~ SF)
# Boxplot showing SF’s relationship to Sales

> boxplot(Sales ~ Alpha)
# Boxplot showing Alpha’s relationship to Sales

> boxplot(Sales ~ Region, xlim = c(0.6,7.4), col="light blue")
# Boxplot showing Region’s relationship to Sales, X-axis limits are shown, box color is light blue

> boxplot(Sales ~ Density.Cap, main = "Density Effect on Sales", xlab = "Density Cap", ylab = "Sales", col="light green")
# Boxplot showing Density.Cap’s relationship to Sales, Title name is shown, X-Axis name is shown, Y-Axis name is shown, box color is light green

> table(Alpha,Region)
# Table showing store counts by Alpha and Region

> table(Alpha,Climate)
# Table showing store counts by Alpha and Climate

> table(Alpha,Climate,Region)
# Table showing store counts by Alpha, Climate, and Region

> flat.table = ftable(table(Alpha,Climate,Region))
# Store output so we can work with it

> prop.table(flat.table,1)
# Convert raw counts to proportions 

> store.pct <- prop.table(flat.table,1)
# Store proportions as “store.pct”

> store.pct[] <- sprintf("%.1f%%",round(prop.table(store.pct,1)*100, 3))
# Convert proportions to percents with 1 decimal place

> store.pct
# Print “store.pct”

> alpha.by.climate = table(Climate, Alpha)
# Store Climate-Alpha table as “alpha.by.climate”

> barplot(alpha.by.climate, beside=T, main="Alpha by Climate", ylab="Freq", xlab="Alpha", col=c("blue","red","green"))
# Boxplot of “alpha.by.climate” with title, X-axis, and Y-axis shown, and columns colored

> legend(x=8.5, y=25, legend=c("Cold","Hot","Swing"),fill=c("blue","red","green"))
# Show legend with legend size, and color key

> results = chisq.test(alpha.by.climate)
> results
# Show Chi-Square test of “alpha.by.climate”

> results$expected
# View the expected values

> results$residuals
# View the residuals in each cell

> aov.out = aov(Sales ~ SF + Climate + Region + Density.Cap, data=stores)
> summary(aov.out)
# Request a 4-way ANOVA without testing the interactions

> TukeyHSD(aov.out, which=c("Climate"))
# A Tukey HSD post hoc test (Tukey multiple comparisons of means)

> round(cor(stores[,c(3,6,7)]),2)
# Show correlation matrix among Density.Cap, SF, and Sales

> lm.model = lm(Sales ~ SF + Climate + Region + Density.Cap, data=stores)
> summary(lm.model)
# Show a linear multiple regression using the lm( ), or "linear model" function of store attributes to sales

> step(lm.model, direction="backward")
# Do backwards regression to eliminate the nonsignificant terms

> rm(list=ls()) 
# Clean up file
